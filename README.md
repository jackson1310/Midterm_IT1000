A Midterm Project
=================
My name is Jackson Maloney and I am student at University of Missouri-Columbia
studying Information technology.
For this project I am to create a website using the Markdown programming language.
So far it is the easiest language I have used. I wish I could use this language
for all of my programming classes.

Picture Time

This is a picture of a honey badger. They are known to kill predators much more
stronger and deadlier than they are, just on the sheer capability of their courage
and indominable spirit. Honey badger don't care.
