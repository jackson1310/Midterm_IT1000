# Can you bounce a ball to the moon?
[Home](README.md)
Growing up I always asked myself this question. I spent years in deep thought
thinking of a scenario that would allow me to bounce a ball to the moon. About 5
entire years of my childhood were spent in solitude pondering on the thought of one
day bouncing a ball to the moon. After mastering the physical sciences by age 8
(and being awarded an Honorary degree from MIT) I arrived at the conclusion that
it is indeed possible.

The image I just shared with you is a sketch I created after one of my biggest breakthroughs.
I actually had to sketch this on a piece of a toilet paper, you can imagine where my
best spot for inspiration is. None the less, this graph represents that if you were
to throw a ball at a distance greater than that of the moon to the Earth. Bounce it off
of the Earth's surface. It would then proceed to bounce all the way to the moon.
So in theory, **Yes** you can bounce a ball to the moon.
